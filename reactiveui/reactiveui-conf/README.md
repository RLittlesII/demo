## Abstract

These days, it's best to get a spot in line for a seat at a table.  With most establishments not having full capacity and adhering to social distancing, someone should build an app that allows you to schedule a spot in a virtual line as opposed to a physical one?

During this talk we will walk through the architecture of an application designed for Social Distance Queuing.  We'll show how we can queue for an establishment, receive notifications on when appointment time is close, and navigate through establishments for a day out on the town.  Everything built using ReactiveUI and functional programming.  We'll get a chance to see how ReactiveUI can be used as an MVVM framework to build an indepth real world.
